Pipistrello
===========

**Pipistrello** is a utility that **allows you to create and run Map/Reduce jobs** with 
(almost) any executable or script as the mapper and/or the reducer in pretty much 
the same way as hadoop-streaming. The fundamental difference is that Pipistrello
is specially designed to operate **on binary files (NetCDF, jpg, png, mp3... you name it!)**.

Background
----------

Pipistrello's original goal is to bring powerful technologies used by the industry 
(Google, Facebook, Spotify, Amazon...) into scientists laboratories. As the amount of
data generated by science grows at unprecedented speed, scientists need software to 
catch up and harness the power of their data. Unfortunately, the general situation up to now
is that the software available in their labs is quite poor when compared to the software 
they use at home for handling their music or photo collections. Science deserves better.
