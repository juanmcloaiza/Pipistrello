Pipistrello
===========

**Pipistrello** is a utility that **allows you to create and run Map/Reduce jobs** with 
(almost) any executable or script as the mapper and/or the reducer in pretty much 
the same way as hadoop-streaming. The fundamental difference is that Pipistrello
is specially designed to operate **on binary files (NetCDF, jpg, png, mp3... you name it!)**.

Background
----------

Pipistrello's original goal is to bring powerful technologies used by the industry 
(Google, Facebook, Spotify, Amazon...) into scientists laboratories. As the amount of
data generated by science grows with unprecedented speed, scientists need software than 
can catch up to harness the power of their data. Unfortunately, the general situation up to now
is that the software they have at home for handling their music or photo collection is
usually better than they have in the lab for handling their data.
