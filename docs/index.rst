Pipistrello
===========

Pipistrello is a utility that allows you to create and run Map/Reduce jobs with 
(almost) any executable or script as the mapper and/or the reducer in pretty much 
the same way as hadoop-streaming. The fundamental difference is that Pipistrello
is specially designed to operate on binary files (NetCDF, jpg, png, mp3... you name it!).

Today most of researchers have better software at home for handling their music or 
photo collections than they have in the laboratory for doing the same with their research data.
The original scope of Pipistrello is to bring these powerful technologies also into their labs.
